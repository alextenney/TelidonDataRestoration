# TelidonDataRestoration

## Abstract

How do we preserve our digital heritage? The Telidon computing system signifies a time in Canadian digital history when Canada took the lead on interconnected networks and graphics technology, and should be celebrated and preserved. It also marks the beginning of a new art Renaissance, where digital mediums take hold. But updating the files to modern standards is essential in this preservation, as a binary that is unviewable serves no value. This CPSC 503 project will attempt to restore Telidon data files within a binary backup of a Telidon system in order to continue the work of the University of Victoria Head Librarian, John Durno, and maintain a significant archive of Telidon artworks, updated to modern digital formats, so others can see.

## Description

This repo will be used for the purpose of displaying my CPSC 503 Project to others. The project will largely be practical, focusing on reverse engineering techniques, as well as some programming. Python will be the language of choice for the project, since it is my strongest, and is easiest to script with. If you would like a more comprehensive description of the project, my Project Propsoal, written as a component of CPSC 503 will be of interest. 

## Credits

I want to thank my supervisor, Dr. John Aycock, for choosing me to work on this project, and also providing me with support throughout. Dr. Ayacock has also worked on this project himself, and has provided some starting points of a script, and has extensive knowledge of legacy computing systems. Find about more on his website: https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/

I also want to thank University of Victoria Head Librarian John Durno, who gave Dr. Aycock the Telidon data in which this project hinges on, and also makes up for the bulk of academic Telidon restoration and archival work.
